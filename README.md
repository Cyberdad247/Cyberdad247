### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Cyberdad247

I'm a passionate developer and AI enthusiast, currently building **Camelot.AI**, a futuristic reimagining of the Arthurian legend as a cyberpunk-themed Progressive Web Application (PWA).

**About Me:**

I'm on a journey to explore the fascinating intersection of AI, storytelling, and user experience. I believe in the power of AI to augment human creativity and create new possibilities for interaction and problem-solving. As a lifelong learner, I'm always eager to experiment with new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible. When i'm not coding you can catch me being a dad.

**My Project: Camelot.AI**

**Camelot.AI** is my current passion project. It's a unique platform where users interact with 12 specialized AI agents, the Knights of the Round Table, each powered by a carefully chosen local LLM and designed with a distinct personality.

**Here's the vision:**

*   **Cyberpunk Camelot:**  A futuristic world where the spirit of the Round Table is embodied in advanced AI.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Accessible from any device with a modern web browser, offering an app-like experience.
*   **Arthur, the Multimodal AI:**  A central coordinator that understands user requests (text, voice, and potentially vision) and intelligently routes them to the appropriate Knight.
*   **12 Specialized Knights:** Each Knight excels in a specific domain (research, writing, coding, strategy, etc.), powered by a local LLM tailored to their role.
*   **Merlin, the Backend:**  Manages the platform, provides a "Cline" API for advanced control, and houses "Merlin's Lab" for experimentation.
*   **Beam Chat Interface:** A user-friendly chat interface inspired by ChatGPT, but enhanced with dynamic visuals that reflect the active Knight.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Users can personalize their experience with themes like Cyber-Medieval, Holo-Arthurian, and Bio-Digital Camelot.

**Tech Stack Highlights:**

*   **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), React Router v6, Workbox, Bolt.anything-llm (for prototyping)
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Supabase (database, authentication)
*   **Agents:** Atomic Agents framework (modified), Ten Agent (for Arthur's multimodality), Fish Speech (STT/TTS)
*   **LLMs:** Local models (Phi-2, Mistral 7B, Gemma, Code Llama, etc.) via `local.ai`, Ollama (function calling)
*   **Other Tools:** n8n (Knight workflows), Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Langfuse (monitoring), Roo-Cline (VS Code assistant)

**Current Focus:**

*   Building the foundation of Camelot.AI: frontend, backend, and core agent framework.
*   Developing Arthur's multimodal capabilities and intelligent Knight routing.
*   Creating the 12 specialized Knights with their unique skills and personalities.
*   Experimenting with local LLMs and optimizing for performance.

**Future Goals:**

*   Implement "Merlin's Lab" for exploring new AI models and agent configurations.
*   Create a "Knight Marketplace" for sharing custom tools, prompts, and agent configurations.
*   Explore advanced AI techniques like Constitutional AI and self-refinement.
